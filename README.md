### Tools Required

Python 2.7 is used during development and following libraries are required to run the code provided in the notebook:
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Librosa

### Dataset

The UrbanSound8k dataset used for model training, can be downloaded from the following [[link]](https://serv.cusp.nyu.edu/projects/urbansounddataset/urbansound8k.html)

*Note: This is work in progress to employ deep learning for automatic categorization of environmental sounds.*
